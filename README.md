# Jokes

This project is somewhat of a continuation of [15Dkatz's official joke API](https://github.com/15Dkatz/official_joke_api) which now seems dead, so some unmerged PRs from there are also incuded in the data here.

Differences between the projects: My implementation is in PHP, it uses a slightly different data format, and I don't provide an API via HTTP, as the data itself is static and randomisation is not cachable.
